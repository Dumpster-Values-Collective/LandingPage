      <h2>Sell Your Wardrobe</h2>
      <p>What we look for: Vintage and classic timeless contemporary clothing, shoes and accessories that are clean and in good condition. We aim to preserve special vintage pieces so bring those in regardless of condition. All purchase offers are final and not open to negotiation. </p>

      <p>Our inventory needs vary from time to time and are not always predictable. We rarely take every item from a trade. Our dollar bin is a great way to donate directly to our community. The Dollar Bin serves as a sliding scale low barrier clothing bank. Each item is $1, donated to our local Books To Prisoners chapter, or free to those who canâ€™t afford to donate.</p>
